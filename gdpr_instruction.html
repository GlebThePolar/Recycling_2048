<strong>Who Has Your Data</strong> 
<p>During your usage of my game ("Recycling: 2048" app), some information 
about you is being collected. Generally speaking, this information is used 
for ads and some statistics. You can see more in the 
<a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p> 
<p>All of this information is being collected and processed by Unity. 
I can access this data only through Unity, and for me, all of this data 
is already depersonalized. So, I can't even distinguish your personal data 
from data of other players. That is why you need to contact Unity directly 
- here, I will give you instructions.</p>
