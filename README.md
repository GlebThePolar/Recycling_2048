Hi! The instruction for updating translations is ready!
In short:
1. Download the necessary file from translations folder
2. Open it in an editor (for example, Google Sheets)
3. Translate
4. Save the file in TSV format (same as the original file), but than rename it to .csv (for GitHub)
5. Push it to the issue branch
