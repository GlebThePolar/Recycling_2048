Hello and welcome to 'Recycling: 2048'! Are you ready for some challenge? In this tutorial you'll learn the base needed for recycling, but some features you only can find by yourself!	Sawubona futhi wamukelekile ku-'Recycling: 2048'! Ingabe uyilungele inselele ethile? Kulesi sifundo uzofunda isisekelo esidingekayo sokugaywa kabusha, kodwa ezinye izici ungazithola wedwa!
There are 4 magnets around the field (orange objects). You can activate them by swiping (move your finger on the screen). They can move any magnetic materials - perfect for the details we work with! Give it a try by moving an object (like the bolt) three times.	Kukhona omazibuthe aba-4 ebaleni (izinto eziwolintshi). Ungawenza asebenze ngokuswayipha (hambisa umunwe wakho esikrinini). Bangakwazi ukuhambisa noma yiziphi izinto ezisetshenziswa kazibuthe - zilungele imininingwane esisebenza ngayo! Izame ngokuhambisa into (njengebhawodi) kathathu.
A new detail has appeared: a bolt. While some might see it as garbage, we can recycle it into something more advanced, like a gear!	Kuvele imininingwane entsha: ibhawudi. Nakuba abanye bengase bakubone njengodoti, singase sikusebenzise kabusha siye kokuthile okuthuthuke kakhulu, njengegiya!
Recycle two bolts into a gear by moving them together.	Sebenzisa kabusha amabhawodi amabili egiyeni ngokuwahambisa ndawonye.
Fantastic! You've just recycled some garbage! Keep it up, and together we can reach our goal of creating a better life.	Kumnandi! Usanda kuvuselela udoti othile! Qhubeka, futhi ngokubambisana singafinyelela umgomo wethu wokudala impilo engcono.
Oh, no, the magnet has broken! :({#} You see, the right magnet is red now.	Hhayi, umazibuthe uphukile! :({#} Uyabona, uzibuthe ongakwesokudla ubomvu manje.
Try activating the right magnet a few times and see that nothing happens. (Swipe to the right)	Zama ukwenza kusebenze uzibuthe ofanele izikhathi ezimbalwa futhi ubone ukuthi akwenzeki lutho. (Swayiphela kwesokudla)
You see, nothing happened. Now try swiping in different directions (up and down). Let's wait until the magnet repairs itself.	Uyabona, akwenzekanga lutho. Manje zama ukuswayipha ngezindlela ezihlukene (phezulu naphansi). Ake silinde uze uzilungise uzibuthe.
Done! After several moves, all magnets will be repaired.	Kwenziwe! Ngemuva kokunyakaza okuningana, wonke amamagnethi azolungiswa.
Now, let's talk about bio garbage (the apple leftover). Try moving it.	Manje, ake sikhulume ngodoti we-bio (i-apula esele). Zama ukuyihambisa.
Because bio garbage lacks magnetic materials, magnets can't move it.	Ngenxa yokuthi udoti we-bio awunazo izinto ezinozibuthe, omazibuthe abakwazi ukuwuhambisa.
Don't forget to sort your garbage! :)	Ungakhohlwa ukuhlunga udoti wakho! :)
This is a rust garbage. It can't be recycled either. The number indicates how much time it needs to rust away and disappear.	Lona udoti wokugqwala. Ayikwazi ukugaywa kabusha futhi. Inombolo ikhombisa ukuthi singakanani isikhathi esidinga ukugqwala nokunyamalala.
Amazing! You've improved your recycling skills!	Kuyamangalisa! Uthuthukise amakhono akho okugaya kabusha!
Congratulations on acquiring the workshop! Let's dive into a quick tutorial on how to make the most of it.	Siyakuhalalisela ngokuthola i-workshop! Ake singene esifundweni esisheshayo sokuthi ungakwenza kanjani ngokugcwele.
Combine simple details instantly from all fields using the workshop. Give it a try now!	Hlanganisa imininingwane elula ngokushesha kuzo zonke izinkambu usebenzisa i-workshop. Izame manje!
It's pretty cool, right? Just keep in mind the cooldown. It takes some time, so use it wisely!	Kupholile, akunjalo? Gcina nje engqondweni ukuphola. Kuthatha isikhathi, ngakho sebenzisa ngokuhlakanipha!
Be cautious when there's only one detail available for the workshop. It won't be able to combine it and will just return the item back.	Qaphela uma kunomniningwane owodwa kuphela otholakalayo weshabhu. Ngeke ikwazi ukuyihlanganisa futhi izovele ibuyisele into emuva.
So, just use it carefully.	Ngakho-ke, vele uyisebenzise ngokucophelela.
The workshop shines when you're surrounded by annoying simple details. It's the perfect tool to tidy up your space efficiently!	Iworkshop iyakhanya uma uzungezwe imininingwane elula ecasulayo. Kuyithuluzi eliphelele lokuqoqa isikhala sakho kahle!

To use the crane, simply tap on the icon. Now, you've entered CRANE mode.	Ukuze usebenzise i-crane, mane uchofoze isithonjana. Manje, ufake imodi ye-CRANE.
In CRANE mode, choose an item on the field that you'd like to interact with.	Kumodi ye-CRANE, khetha into ebaleni ongathanda ukusebenzisana nayo.
Next, select an empty field where you want to move the chosen item.	Okulandelayo, khetha inkambu engenalutho lapho ufuna ukuhambisa khona into ekhethiwe.
Now, press on the crane once more to execute the action.	Manje, cindezela ku-crane futhi ukuze wenze isenzo.
As you upgrade, you'll gain the ability to change not only to empty fields but also swap them with other items.	Njengoba uthuthuka, uzothola ikhono lokushintshela hhayi ezinkambu ezingenalutho kuphela kodwa futhi uzishintshanise nezinye izinto.
Don't be afraid to experiment! If you encounter an error, the game will provide an indication. {#}Try to cause an error (e.g., click on 2 empty cells).	Ungesabi ukuzama! Uma uhlangabezana nephutha, igeyimu izokunikeza inkomba. {#}Zama ukwenza iphutha (isb., chofoza amaseli angenalutho angu-2).
This is the error indication.	Lesi inkomba yephutha.
And last, but not least, try deselecting. To do so, press on the previously selected item, or on the crane (if you haven't selected the second cell yet).	Okokugcina, kodwa okungenani, zama ukususa ukukhetha. Ukwenza njalo, cindezela entweni ekhethwe ngaphambilini, noma kukhreyini (uma ungakayikhethi iseli yesibili).
Congratulations on upgrading your fence! Let's see what it is capable of now.	Siyakuhalalisela ngokuthuthukisa uthango lwakho! Ake sibone ukuthi ikwazi ukwenzani manje.
To use the fence, click on one of the blue (cyan) objects around the field.	Ukuze usebenzise ucingo, chofoza enye yezinto eziluhlaza okwesibhakabhaka (cyan) ezizungeze inkundla.
