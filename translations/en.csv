A crane is a tool that allows you to relocate objects on the field. The basic version works only by dragging light objects to an empty place. With upgrades, you can drag more complex items, and even swap two objects. To use it, click on the crane icon, select the object, and select a place, where you want to place it.

Tired of simple parts messing around with your advanced builds? Use the workshop!{#}Workshop - a small separated building where manual processing of simple parts is possible. The higher the level of the workshop, the more parts it can process. Also, the improvement allows you to use it more often.{#}To use, click on the workshop icon unless it is on cooldown.

Did you see that thing around your field corners? How about making it useful? Improve your fence by adding the ability to open it!{#}Allows you to get rid of non-mechanical debris. Further improvements to the pumps are possible, allowing the use of the hydraulic fence more frequently.{#}To use, click on the desired section of the fence, and pull the parts in that direction. All parts in the row where the fence is open will be thrown away. Remember: safety first!	Did you see that thing around your field corners? How about making it useful?

Unfortunately, not everyone is responsible for sorting waste.

Global climate change, and even in the desert rains have become common. Perhaps for someone, it is even useful, but some parts can rust, making it impossible to recycle them. Strengthening of waterproofing reduces the likelihood of corrosion of parts.	Global climate change, and even in the desert rains have become common.

Want to speed up the recycling process? Add a pre-assembly unit to your transporter!

Nothing is perfect. It also applies to the assembly process. Have you noticed, that sometimes parts break during merging? Fortunately, I can assure you, that it affects only the assembly of engine - more complicated parts are no problem. But still annoying, right?{#}But you can make this process more reliable, by calibrating your equipment.{#}This upgrade is mandatory, if you want to increase the size of your field.

Pros of stacking items in deserts - they don't rust much in dry environments. Cons - it can be really hot here.{#}The more you work, the more time you need to wait between each recycling, allowing your equipment to return to an appropriate temperature. It leads to more items accumulating between your moves. You can upgrade the cooling system, providing yourself a longer time for recycling.{#}This upgrade is mandatory, if you want to increase the size of your field.

Have you ever asked yourself, why do I have so small field? Isn't it inconvenient to work with big builds?
